        I'm a 22-year-old senior at the University of Iowa originally from Iowa City,
     and I plan to graduate in May 2024 with degrees in Finance and Business Analytics and Information Systems. <br> I've worked on a bunch of projects in school that really helped me get better at analyzing data and understanding finance, which I enjoy learning. I love being outside, whether it's playing soccer, hiking, or just hitting the golf course with my buddies. After I get my diploma, I'm heading to Atlanta, Georgia, to start working as a Business Data Analyst. I'm more into the analytics side of things, but my job will let me do a bit of both, which is great. Down the road, I'm thinking about moving somewhere along the coast to mix things up and see more of what's out there.
